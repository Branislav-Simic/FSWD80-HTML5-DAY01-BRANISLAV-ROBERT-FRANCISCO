<div>
	<p>Loving can hurt<br>
Loving <span style="color:red">can hurt sometimes</span><br>
But it's the only thing that I know<br>
When it gets hard<br>
You know it can get hard sometimes<br>
It is the only thing that makes us feel alive</p>
</div>
<div><p>We keep this love in a photograph<br>
We made these memories for ourselves<br>
Where our eyes are never closing<br>
Hearts are never broken<br>
Times forever frozen still</p></div>

<div>
	<p>So you can keep me<br>
Inside the pocket<br>
Of your ripped jeans<br>
Holdin' me closer<br>
'Til our eyes meet<br>
You won't ever be alone<br>
Wait for me to come home
</p>
</div>
<div>
	<p>
Loving can heal<br>
Loving can mend your soul<br>
And it's the only thing that I know (know)<br>
I swear it will get easier<br>
Remember that with every piece of ya<br>
And it's the only thing we take with us when we die
</p>
</div>
<div>
	<p>We keep this love in a photograph<br>
We made these memories for ourselves<br>
Where our eyes are never closing<br>
Hearts were never broken<br>
Times forever frozen still</p></div>

<div>
	<p>
So you can keep me<br>
Inside the pocket<br>
Of your ripped jeans<br>
Holdin' me closer<br>
'Til our eyes meet<br>
You won't ever be alone
</p>
</div>

<div>
	<p>
And if you hurt me<br>
That's OK, baby, only words bleed<br>
Inside these pages you just hold me<br>
And I won't ever let you go
</p>
</div>

<div>
	<p>
Wait for me to come home<br>
Wait for me to come home<br>
Wait for me to come home<br>
Wait for me to come home
</p>
</div>

<div>
	<p>
Oh you can fit me<br>
Inside the necklace you got when you were sixteen<br>
Next to your heartbeat<br>
Where I should be<br>
Keep it deep within your soul
</p>
</div>

<div>
	<p>
And if you hurt me<br>
Well, that's OK, baby, only words bleed<br>
Inside these pages you just hold me<br>
And I won't ever let you go
</p>
</div>

<div>
	<p>
When I'm away<br>
I will remember how you kissed me<br>
Under the lamppost<br>
Back on 6th street<br>
Hearing you whisper through the phone<br>
"Wait for me to come home"
