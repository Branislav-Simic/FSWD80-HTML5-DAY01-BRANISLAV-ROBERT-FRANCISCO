	<h1>Scarface 1983</h1>

	<div>
		<p>
	<span style="color:red">Scarface</span>  is a feature film by <i>Brian De Palma</i> , in which <b>Al Pacino plays the eponymous lead role</b>. </p>

<p>
	<em>The film is a very freely interpreted by De Palma remake of the original by Howard Hawks from the year 1932.</em> The original of <b>Al Capone</b> ajar climb to the <b>crime boss</b> story was the Miami moved 1980s and shows the rise and fall of <b>Cuban immigrant Tony Montanain the world of <span style="color:red">gangsters and cocaine trafficking.</span></b></p>


<p>
	The personalities of the historic Al Capone and the fictitious Tony Montana, however, have little in common. While in the movie the socially completely incompatible Tony owes his rise almost exclusively to his brutality and cold-bloodedness, Al Capone increased his power not least by his negotiating skills, with which he was able to bring former rivals by concessions on his side.</p>
